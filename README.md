# Smart Menu React App

Using an API called Tasty by Dojo APIs to fetch meals searched for either by ingredients or key words. The API returns information about cook/prep times, ingredients required, recipes, and instruction's, as well as nutritional values.

I would like to continue working on this small project not only to demonstrate my ability to work with React and RESTful API's but also to expand on this idea and later include some filters that pertain to an individuals personal activity records and exercise goals.


Continous deployment with Github and Netlify

### To do's

1. Clean up UI 
  a. (Animate toggling between food cards.)
  b. (Animate cards flipping with Recipe and instructions on back.)
2. Add small form to filter meals by individual macro-nutrient needs
3. Fix prev and next buttons
4. Clean up styling altogether 




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
